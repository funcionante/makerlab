# What is MakerLab?

_(DETI) MakerLab_ is a system designed to manage a new room
[DETI](https://www.ua.pt/deti/) (the department to which we belong) recently
acquired. This room is filled with electronic components and devices, such as
Arduinos, Raspberries, 3D printers, a network closet and the like. The space
aims at being _the_ room to carry on projects inside DETI.

Being the Department of Electronics, Telecommunications, and Informatics, DETI
couldn't let the opportunity escape to instead of buying a closed-source,
casual management software, support the development of a solution which defies
the currently standard way of building such systems. This is when we enter in
scene.

Having been invited to produce the software that powers the room as our
bachelor's degree project, here are a few key points expressed by our mentor
which called to our attention:
*   Make the system highly **modularized** and **loosely coupled**.  
    Any component should be easily swaped (or removed).
*   **Don't reinvent the wheel**. Reuse existing projects.  
    Keep close to upstream, so that mantaining the project is painless.
*   Make the system **autonomous**.  
    _MakerLab_ shouldn't require a superviser, though one might exist.
*   Make the system **easy to use** and **fun**.  
    Management for the users, not for the manager.
*   Plan for the **future**.  
    Don't make restrictions to what the system will be capable of providing.

_MakerLab_ uses many technologies. One of our main mottoes is to "don't
reinvent the wheel".
