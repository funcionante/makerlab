All the knowledge of the system is on the wiki. On the one hand, wiki provides tools to manage equipments, projects and users. On the other, users can collaboratively edit articles, in a version controlled way, to document and share all the information that assists students making their projects happen.

### Login

Forget the accounts. Wiki comes with UA's authentication system.

### Home Page

Everybody goes to Google when looking for something. We intend to provide the same experience. Wiki's homepage has a search bar where you can find what you are looking for: a project, an equipment, a user.

### Articles

Users can collaboratively edit articles, in a version controlled way, to document and share all the information that assists students making their projects happen.

### Equipment's Management

The room's manager can add new equipments and manage their stock and requisitions. He has a log of active and past requisitions. If an equipment is lost during a requisition, it can be easily marked. When a requisition occurs, the user and manager are notified by email.

### Project's Management

Users are integrated in projects. In the project's management page, the members are listed, and also their requisitions. If a project is waiting for a mentor, users can ask a teacher for it. The system will automatically send an email to notify the request. Afterwards, the invited teacher can approve the project. After being approved, users are finally able to do requisitions in the context of that project. The group can be easily emailed at the distance of a click.

### User Profile's Management

User profile's management pages shows useful information from each user. There, the user's requisitions are logged. If it is the case, the manager can promote a user to a teacher. Again, emails can easily be sent to each user.

### Room's stats

Thanks to the roomâ€™s video vigilance and through some image processing, we can detect movement, estimating the occupation of the room in real time. We use it to provide stats of how the room is used during the day.
