The `mobile app` will be the main bridge between the users and the system.
It'll provide the possibility to:
* Manage pending requisitions, providing information of the project to which it is
associated and the number of units requested;
* Create and manage projects with which the user is involved and add new members
to them. 
* Make item requisitions and deliveries.

## Login

The users will be able to login into the app with their University of Aveiro's
credentials, and , in order to automate and make things easier, it will have an
auto-login feature, so that the users don't have to keep filling the login form 
every time they want to use the app.

## Projects

There is a place where the users can show to others everything that
has been done on a project and, in the case of equipments, give them ideas of
how to use them, leading them to develop new ideas and continuing the loop.

In order to populate and maintain this important space, the app will allow them
to manage the two most important parts - projects and their participants.
By creating and manage projects and adding a colleague to a project, 
users will be able to access all project information and documentation in order
to start their work in no time.

## Requisitions

The equipments spread across the lab will be labeled with QR Codes.
The users will be able to point to them and sneak peek some information about
them with an Augmented Reality touch, which is particularly useful if they're
not familiar with the equipment.

If they are pointing to the intended item, they can select it and choose the
project name that the requisition will be associated to.

The users will also be able to deliver items they previously requested
through the app. The process is almost the same as to making a requisition.
Simply pointing the phone's camera to the QR code pasted in the item and
clicking "Deliver" will do the trick.
