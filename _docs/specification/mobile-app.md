The `mobile app` will be the bridge between the users and the system. 
It'll provide the possibility to: 
* Manage pending requisitions, having information of how long certain equipment 
is associated with a project;
* Manage projects where the user is involved;
* Make item requisitions;
* Manage projects' private network (associate RJ-45 sockets to them).

## Login

The users will be able to login into the app with their University of Aveiroâ€™s
credentials, just like in the wiki's webpage.

In order to automate and make things much easier, the app will have an auto-login
feature, so that the users don't have to keep filling the login form every time
they use the app.

## Projects

The app will provide a place where the users can show the others everything that
has been done on a project and, in the case of equipments, give others 
an idea of how to use them, leading them to develop new ideas.

In order to populate and maintain this important space, the app will allow them
to manage the main important part of a project - their participants.
By "fast adding" a colleague to a project, users will be able to access all 
project information and documentation in order to start their work in no time.

## Requisitions

The equipments spread across the room will be labeled with QR Codes.
The users will be able to point to them and sneak peek what are in front of them 
with an Augmented Reality touch, which is very useful if they're not familiar 
with the equipment. 

If they are pointed to the pretended item, they can pick it and select
the project name that this requisition will be associated to.

The users will also be able to deliver items they previously requested through 
the app. The process is the almost the same as to making a requisition. 
Simply pointing to the QR code pasted in the item and clicking "Deliver it" will 
do the trick.
