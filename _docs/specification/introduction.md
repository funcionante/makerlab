## Our Vision

DETI MakerLab (DML) is a system designed to manage a modern and innovative room. 
This room is filled with electronic components and devices, such as Arduinos,
Raspberries, 3D printers, a network closet and the like. The space aims at being
the room to carry on projects inside DETI.

Our goal is to provide a flexible platform to manage an hacker space like DML,
easing the students' and manager's lives, and to solve some of the space current 
issues.
