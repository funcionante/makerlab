The `mobile app` will be the bridge between the user and the system. 
With it you will be able to :
* Manage your pending requisitions, having information of how long you 
are using an equipment;
* Manage projects you are attending;
* Make item requisitions;

## Login

You will be able to login into the app with your University of Aveiroâ€™s
credentials, the same way you did in wiki's webpage.

In order to automate and make things much easier, the app will have an auto-login
feature, so you will not need to fill a login form always you want to use the app.

## Projects

You will have a place where you can show everything you do, and help others
to have an idea of what have been done with some equipments, so they can 
develop new ideas.

In order to populate and mantain this important space, the app will allow you
to manage the main important part of a project - the user.
By "fast adding" a friend to a project, he will be able to access all project
information and documentation in order to start his work as soon as possible.

## Requisitions

All over the room the equipments will be labeled with QR Codes. You will be able
to point to them and sneak peek what are in front of you with an Augmented Reality
touch, which is very usefull if you don't know the equipment. 
If the item you are pointing is the right one, you can pick it and select
the project name you want to associate this requisition.
