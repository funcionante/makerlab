Although there's still some polishing to do, after a few attempts and some
headaches we now can "fast" print a set of custom labels, which include our
codes. This will hopefully simplify a lot the life of Sr. Arez, who otherwise
would have to print one label by one.

Also, improving last week's release (adding equipments to the wiki), we have
released a new feature when adding units so that it's easy to add multiple
units belonging to a given equipment.

On other news, everything is mostly ready to support requisitions. We are
simply waiting to have items on the wiki so that we can test our new features
before releasing them to public. With the improvements above, hopefully these
shouldn't take too long.
