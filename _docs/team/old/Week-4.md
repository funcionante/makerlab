As promised, this week's major update/upgrade is the site's refactor. It is
now much better, much prettier, user friendlier and useful all around. It's
unrecognisable.

Also, our wiki finally dropped SQLite (which was being used for
development/testing purposes) for a Postgres container.

With the most recent wiki updates, we are close to being capable of releasing
the *Phase 1* of the wiki's delivering schedule. We hope this is possible next
week. By then we will also start adding images (like print screens and such)
to these devlogs.
