We are still building up towards the projects completion.

Missing features have been decreasing at a steady state, and most things are
thus slowing down development. It is starting to become about the little
details at this point.

As an example, the servant + network not only now communicate reasonable well,
as they also start to worry about the way they output information to the
outside world, in a pretty and informative way.

Some improvements were made in our algorithm to measure the average people in the
room during the day.

We are adding features, improving old ones and bug-fixing errors that appear
along the way. We are building towards DETI MakerLab completion one step at a
time (now aiming to the soon to come full demo).
