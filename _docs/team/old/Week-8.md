We now have an assistant - `dml-servant` - the chatbot that will help us
managing DETI's MakerLab. For now, it provides simple endpoints that are
mostly funny but not really useful (e.g. a way to annoy some other users),
however its main goal is to automate some tasks made by the lab users and also
by us. Regarding the users, we will focus on endpoints given special
functionality for the IT students.

UA's auth system is also mostly finished, enabling us to use each user's UU to
login and get their profile information (effectively, from the standpoint of
the users, eliminating the need for yet another account to keep track of).

We have also migrated our services to the STIC's VM, and Sr. Arez has started
to fill in the wiki with some information. This enables us to test what we
were missing, making it possible to schedule the releases we have been holding
on. Expect big updates soon, although we will also be busy documenting
everything.
