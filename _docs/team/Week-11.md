This was an interesting week.

First and foremost we had another milestone (M4) to prepare, which burdened us
with the creation of another presentation and demo. It's the group's opinion
that everything went mostly fine and we are happy with the outcome.

Pressured by the milestone we also got authentication with UA working;
connections through HTTPS done (this was already completed, except for the
integration with mobile apps since we use a self-signed certificate); and
requisitions mostly completed (or so we thought).

Not all roses though... When we went to deploy the system, we found out that a
previously discussed matter turned out to be an issue. Long story short, we
were first asked to consider individual units of equipments, whereas now units
don't exist. I repeat, this had been discussed with both parties (manager and
administrator), it was not lack of planning.

Hopefully we anticipate that the damage can be mostly repaired within a week,
it is just unpleasant to have to fix something that should have never been
broken.

Now onto the future: This week (12) we begin phase 3 of project development.
This means we will begin integrating the datacenter (currently supporting the
creation of VMs), as well as developing some new, different things (aside from
maintaining what has already been developed/deployed).

As a sneak peek, we have planned the development of a "How many people in the
room?" feature, as well as having the chatbot handling the interface with the
datacenter's management API.
