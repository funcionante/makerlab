We are still bulding up towards the projects completion.

Missing features have been decreasing at a steady state, and most things are
thus slowing down development. It is starting to become about the little
details at this point.

As an example, the servant + network not only now communicate reasonable well,
as they also start to worry about the way they output information to the
outside world, in a pretty and informative way.

We are adding features, improving old ones and bugfixing errors that appear
along the way. We are building towards DETI MakerLab completion one step at a
time (now aiming to the soon to come full demo).
