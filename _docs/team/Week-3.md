We started launching containers!

Although still far from complete and not even open to public, this was the
first time we were capable of launching VMs programmatically.

We also scheduled a major front-page refactor, which will hopefully make our
site's front page much friendlier and useful.

On other news, our wiki went from english to portuguese, at least for its
first version. This also meant start indexing articles in portuguese. This is
mostly solved now.
