We have started integrating the Network Manager (NM) with its public interface
(chatbot). The network manager had also to be changed. While we were expecting
a switch with VXLAN capabilities, we now will only be capable of using one
without. This meant refactoring the overall network architecture, but things
should proceed without much fuzz.

Our Android app also saw visual improvements, and we are back on track with
the requisition platform (after that last minute change we were imposed).

As an addition, we have also started experimenting with ideas for people
counting. We expect to have it working soon.
