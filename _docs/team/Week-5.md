First partial release of the platform!

This week brought many news. On the one hand, there was the first project's
presentation, where we presented our overall architecture of the system and
its scheduled features. On the other hand, we delivered "half" of the
platform, by now permitting Sr. Arez (DETI Makerlab's staff) to start adding
news equipments to the wiki.

We've also come to conclude that we will develop both an extra component, a
parser, to better integrate with prof. Diogo's vision of how the system should
behave, as well as a simple utility to facilitate Sr. Arez product labelling
workflow. Hopefully these will not consume much time.

As a side effect of the team's presentation, we now feel we have a much more
crystallised vision of the system and a map of how things will fit together.
As an example, the plugin-based section of the architecture is pretty much
established, contrary to what used to be true.

Yet, we've once again stomped on the network's section. What we thought was to
be done in Layer 3 will be Layer 2, which further pushed the network's
delivery schedule.

Next week: Requisitions!
