The week started with the first "full project" demo. Its our opinion that
everything went mostly well. We received good feedback, and had the opportunity
to discuss ideas with many different professors and visitors, which enabled us
to collect relevant features that we decided to include.

So what have we been working on?

We implemented a big portion of these features. They were mostly small things,
such as displaying this information in this page, of that graph in that other
place. We did it.

We also configured a mail agent, so that we can now send email
@deti-makerlab.ua.pt! This also means that we can start sending emails logging
requisitions and all those other niceties we had been talking about for so
long.

New endpoints to the servant were also added, giving answer to the (also) new
endpoints of the NetworkManager (namely port's management).

Oh, and we also developed a nice poster for the students@deti event.

There's still a not so small path till we can see this project's completion,
though we are heading full power mode aiming towards a strong finish!
