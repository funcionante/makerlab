Things have been closing during the last week (and will continue to do so).

No new features are being accepted and schedule for development, now the
main focus being to have everything working as soon as possible.

For reference:
* The wiki is mostly OK. Until the apps are completed we can't really call it
  closed, but not much remains to do. The exception including features
  regarding groups of users and sending email logs.
* The Android app has received a major visual refactor, and now looks quite
  good. Apart from a few set of views, is mostly complete.
* The iOS app halted development a few time ago... Though now trying to pick
  up again, the team is unsure whether this will be possible.
* Network - still needs to be integrated. This should have been done earlier,
  but people keep on pushing the schedule. We'll see.
* Counting people - needs results, but should be done within one to two days.
* Others: might need changes pushed by the other components that are not yet
  closed. Apart from this, they should be OK.

Also, we have recently found another use case for one of our components
(servant) in an IT's project. This is being written in the team's log since it
shows that one of the project's goals (the possibility of using its components
outside the project's scope) is in fact a reality --- this being the first
example of a situation where this will be done.
