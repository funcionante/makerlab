During this week Milestone 1 (M1) was prepared.

This took some time from our schedules, which meant we could progress as much
as we would have liked.

Despite this, a general architecture was proposed accompanied by a draft of
our API; Solr's readings and learning were closed and actual work can begin.

The template of our project's site was also changed, so that it could better
fit its documentation purposes. It is quite different now.
