# Week Log

Where we keep a weekly progress of the project's development.

**Disclaimer**: As MakerLab itself, this page will **not** follow any
given structure. Only interesting aspects of a given week will be highlighted.
Hopefully our issue tracking will give a deeper understanding of the project's
development efforts.
