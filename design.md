title: Design Conventions
---

Along the several MakerLab's visual components there are some design conventions
we established in order to make it uniform. While there are some exceptions,
the standards are defined below.

## Logo
Our logo represents a flask, or maybe something that can explode, a bomb.
This is intended to recall to a lab environment. The symbols printed in the
surface intended to represent electronic circuits, binary and networking.  The
default colour is teal, but there are also black and white variants.

![DML Logo White](../images/logo/dml_logo_white.svg){:width="100px" style="background-color:#e0e0e0"}

## Colors
MakerLab colors are in shades of teal.
* Teal:       `#00796B`{:style="background-color:#00796B"} (logo, titles)
* Light Teal: `#4DB6AC`{:style="background-color:#4DB6AC"} (backgrounds)
* Dark Teal:  `#004D40`{:style="background-color:#004D40"} (not recommended, but used in some scenarios, like text
  in diagrams)

## Fonts
We use two font families, for titles and normal text.
* Default: [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.`{:style="font-family:Roboto"}
* Titles: [Ruda](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ruda) `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.`{:style="font-family:Ruda"}
